""" lazily read an hocr document, returning pages until it's done. 
Pages are returned as cStringIO objects. Expects strict hocr adherence.
</html> must appear on it's own line to end a page... 

Also, note that some hocr that's supposed to be utf-8 is actually latin-1.

Pass in the encoding explicitly if it's different.
